# Projects
One-off projects of random sorts. Built with the help of other coders or existing code tailored to meet my needs. Just homebrew tinkering and projects. I will do my best to describe the project and how it was built and used. Most of the tinkering I do is because I want to learn or play with a piece of electronics and see how I can use them.
